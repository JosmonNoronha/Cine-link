> **🔒 SECURITY NOTICE**: If you cloned or forked this repository before January 31, 2026, please read [SECURITY_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SECURITY_INSTRUCTIONS.md) immediately. API keys were previously exposed and must be rotated.

CineLink is a mobile application built with Expo React Native that allows users to explore, search, and manage their favorite movies and TV series. The app features a dynamic theme switcher (light/dark mode), OTA (over-the-air) updates, and a modern UI with animated components. It leverages the TMDB API for movie data and has a Node.js backend for caching and user management.
Features

Movie & Series Exploration: Browse trending movies, popular hits, and personalized recommendations.
Details Screen: View detailed information, including plots, ratings, and episode lists for series.
Favorites Management: Add or remove movies/series to a favorites list.
Trailer Playback: Watch official trailers using YouTube integration.
Theme Customization: Switch between light and dark themes with a polished settings interface.
OTA Updates: Receive app updates without app store submissions (via Expo EAS).
Responsive Design: Optimized for both iOS and Android with smooth animations.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or later)
Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli or npm install -g @expo/cli)
Git
An OMDB API key (for movie data)
A YouTube API key (for trailers, stored in a .env file)

## Installation

### ⚠️ Security First!

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli or npm install -g @expo/cli)
- Git
- A TMDB API key (for backend - [Get it here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))
- An OMDB API key (optional - [Get it here](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx))
- Firebase project ([Create one here](https://console.firebase.google.com/))

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosmonNoronha/Cine-link.git
cd CineLink
```

### Install Dependencies

#### Frontend
```bash
npm install
```

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

#### Frontend Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your credentials:
   ```bash
   # Get these from Firebase Console → Project Settings
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   
   # Get from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
   OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
   
   # Backend URLs
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
   EXPO_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api
   ```

3. **Never commit your `.env` file!** It's already in `.gitignore`.

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend and copy template:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   # Get from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   
   # Get Firebase Admin Service Account:
   # Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate New Private Key
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_PATH=./firebase-service-account.json
   
   # Optional: Redis for caching
   # REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

3. Download Firebase Service Account JSON:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate New Private Key"
   - Save as `backend/firebase-service-account.json`

4. **Important**: The service account file is gitignored - never commit it!

### Start the Development Server

#### Start Backend (Required)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Backend will run on http://localhost:5001

#### Start Frontend
In a new terminal:
```bash
cd CineLink  # (root directory)
npx expo start
```

## Backend API (Render)

This repo now includes a Node/Express backend in the `backend/` folder that the mobile app can talk to at `/api/*`.

### Deploy on Render

- This repo includes a Render Blueprint at [render.yaml](render.yaml).
- In Render: **New +** → **Blueprint** → select the repo → apply.

### Required environment variables (Render)

- `TMDB_API_KEY` (required)

### Optional environment variables

- `CORS_ORIGIN` (comma-separated allowlist; empty means allow all)
- `REDIS_URL` (enables Redis cache)
- `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`

### Firebase Admin (required only for `/api/user/*` routes)

Pick one option:

- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (recommended; paste the service account JSON as a single env var)

OR

- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (replace newlines with `\n`)

If you don’t set Firebase Admin credentials, unauthenticated endpoints (like `/api/health` and movie/search endpoints) still work, but `/api/user/*` will fail.
